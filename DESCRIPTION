Description: A parser and validator of population genetic demographic
    models specified in the 'Demes' format by Gower et al. (2022)
    <doi:10.1093/genetics/iyac131>. 'Demes' models (encoded as standard
    'YAML' files) are parsed, validated against the formal specification of
    the 'Demes' standard, and represented in memory as standard R objects,
    intended to be easy to inspect by the user and leveraged for simulation
    of genomic data using downstream software according to their preferences.
